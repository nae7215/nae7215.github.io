    <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
      <h3>A Short Bio:</h3>

    <p>I grew up in Bartlett, IL which is a small <span id="whatever"> Northwest vbruwiwlefgbevwhih</span> suburb of Chicago.
I've played softball for 12 years and was a pitcher. I also play flute in band
and I like to read. I'll be attending the University of Chicago come
September and I am so excited! I'll be studying physics and computational
mathematics there.</p>
